                presents a 7-chapter course in JavaScript that gets you off to a great start. This section works for programming novices as well as experienced programmers because it lets you set your own pace. If you’re a beginner, you’ll move slowly
                and do all the exercises. If you have some experience, you’ll move more quickly and do the exercises that you choose. When you finish this section, you’ll have a solid set of JavaScript skills, especially the skills that help you get the
                most from jQuery.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hide">
            <p>After you learn the JavaScript essentials, the 5 chapters in section 2 present the jQuery skills that every web developer should have. The first chapter in this section presents the core jQuery skills, and the next 3 chapters focus on effects
                and animations, forms and data validation, jQuery plugins, and jQuery UI widgets. Then, the last chapter in this section shows you how to use Ajax and JSON so you can get data from a web server and add it to a web page without reloading
                the entire page. After you finish sections 1 and 2, you’ll have the JavaScript and jQuery skills that every web developer should have. The 6 chapters in section 3 will take your JavaScript skills to the next level of expertise. Here, you’ll
                learn how to use numbers, strings, dates...how to handle exceptions and use regular expressions...when and how to use browser objects, cookies, web storage, and arrays...and how to create and use your own objects. The last chapter in this
                section presents expert level skills like how to use closures, the module pattern, and IIFEs as you create your own jQuery plugins.</p>
